    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      Banku and Okro soup is one of the most delicious and requested meal in
      Ghana , West Africa . In Ghanaian cuisine, banku is a swallow dish made of
      a slightly fermented cooked mixture of maize and cassava dough which goes
      well with pepper or soups . This time around we are having it with some
      okro soup and fresh crabs.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Okro Soup</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 medium-sized salmon</li>
      <li>
        1 lb smoked turkey (Note: traditionally most people tend to use beef)
      </li>
      <li>1 pound Okro (Note: Ghanaians call okra "okro")</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>3 medium tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 large onion</li>
      <li>1 tsp. grated ginger</li>
      <li>
        2 chili peppers (scotch bonnets or other red chilis are best), ground or
        finely chopped
      </li>
      <li>3 garden eggs (Substitute aubergines if unavailable)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup mushrooms</li>
      <li>1/2 cup palm oil</li>
      <li>2 cubes of Bouillon cubes Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Banku</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>1 pound cassava dough</li>
      <li>2 pounds corn dough Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <h4>Okro Soup</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Chop half of the pound of okra, then grate the other half. The smaller
        you cut the okra, the better the draw will be.
      </li>
      <li>Cut the stalks off the garden eggs and cut them in half.</li>
      <li>
        Soak the garden eggs and the okra for 10 minutes before transferring
        them to a pot to boil until the garden eggs turn translucent. Remove
        from flame.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate pot, pour 1/2 cup of palm oil. When the oil is hot, add
        the onion, ginger, bouillion cubes, ground chili pepper and garlic.
        (Optional: add some ground ginger). As the mixture softens, add tomato
        and mushrooms, and continue to let it simmer over the fire.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the pot with the palm oil mixture to continue cooking for 2 to 3
        minutes before adding the smoked turkey and fish. Once the turkey and
        fish are sufficiently cooked, add the okra mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the okra into the mixture by turning it from the bottom of the pot
        to the top. Allow the mixture to cook for another 10 minutes. The okra
        is added last in order to avoid over-cooking it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve when ready alongside banku (for Ghanaians) or rice (my personal
        preference).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Banku</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix the 1 cup of water and cassava dough then pour the mixture through a
        sieve to ensure that all the unmilled pieces of cassava and any other
        residue are eliminated.
      </li>
      <li>Add the corn dough to the cassava dough.</li>
      <li>
        Add some salt and mix thoroughly until the mixture thins and becomes
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the pot over medium fire and continue to mix. The banku will become
        more difficult to stir, but continue to mix in order to ensure it does
        not become lumpy. Add about one cup of water and cover the pot for 5
        minutes to allow the water to evaporate and cook the banku further.
        During this time, stir the banku intermittently.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the banku is ready, shape it into a small ball using a spoon.
        Alternatively, if you won't eat all of the banku at once, spoon out
        portions into small plastic bags and roll up the ends.
      </li>
    </ol>
