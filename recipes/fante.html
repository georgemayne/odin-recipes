        till a smooth mixture is obtained.

        Pour the vegetable oil into a clean saucepan and heat for around 2-3
        minutes, then add the diced onions, ginger, and garlic and simmer for 2
        minutes before adding the thyme, parsley, and bay leaves. Cook for
        another 10-15 minutes, or until it begins to bubble.
