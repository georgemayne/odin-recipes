    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        Fufu is a staple food of Ghana. It is a thick 
        whitish mash made of boiled pounded cassava, 
        yam, cocoyam, and plantain, alone or in 
        combination. It is eaten with peanut or palm 
        nut soup, tomatoes, or garden eggs (similar 
        to eggplant). Usually men pound fufu and women 
        turn it.
